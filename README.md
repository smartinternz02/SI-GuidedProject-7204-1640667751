# Detection of Phishing URL using ML

## Overview
A phishing website is a common social engineering system that mimics trusting invariant resource locators (URLs) and webpages. The ideal of this design is to train machine Learning models using Logistic Regression on the dataset created to prognosticate phishing websites. Both phishing and benign URLs of websites are gathered to form a dataset and from them needed URL and website content- grounded features are uprooted. The performance position of each model is measured and compared. 

## Purpose
Successful phishing scams can have a devastating impact. Even phishing attacks that target an organization or company affect the individuals who work for that organization, or customers and partners of that organization.It is Extremely important to Stop Phishing attacks. Hence we have decided to create a model to make it easier for people who have very little knowledge about how these Phishing scams take place so for them we have made this Project as it makes an easy prediction in a matter of Seconds.

## Existing problem
There are Numerous ways to solve this existing problem of detecting these fraudulent phishing problems it starts from user awareness , where users are trained to identify these fraudulent phishing scams and websites so that they can avoid and report them, some methods also include verifying a sites security,using firewalls,using antivirus and controlling what kind of information we enter on to the sites.Keeping browsers up to date while installing security patches thoroughly and in time to stay safe.Thinking before you click and not ending up on any kind of sketchy websites.

##Proposed Solution
We have a solution which involves using the intelligence of computers that is using Artificial intelligence and Machine learning techniques, more specifically Logistic regression in these Techniques to create a web based Phishing detection toolbar interface with the help of python based Flask framework as backend to communicate with the ML trained Logistic regression models from a predefined data set with numerous amount of parameters to Accurately determine and inform us about a potential Phishing site upon inspection.
